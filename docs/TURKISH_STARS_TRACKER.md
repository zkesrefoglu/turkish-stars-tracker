### Double-Doubles
A game where the player reaches 10+ in two statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, or blocks).

### Triple-Doubles
A game where the player reaches 10+ in three statistical categories.

### Career Highs
Maximum single-game values for points, rebounds, assists, and blocks are calculated and displayed in each stat box with "Max: X" label.

### 20+ and 30+ Point Games
Count of games where the player scored 20 or more / 30 or more points.
